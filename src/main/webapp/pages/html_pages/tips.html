                Then, you'll learn what to do differently to help you overcome your fear.

                        Ask your doctor about a calming medication if nothing else helps you.</span>
 <p> Although you likely don’t need medication, sometimes it’s useful for helping you cope with performance anxiety. 
                            Talk to your doctor to find out if medication is a good choice for you. 
                            Then, take it before you give a speech to help you stay relaxed. </p>
<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first time you take the medication should be when you’re at home and don’t have any plans. This will help you see how it affects you.</li>
                        <li>You might decide to use calming medication if you need to do public speaking for your job but are struggling to do it.</li>
